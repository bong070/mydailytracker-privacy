    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Black Knights</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use
      the mobile application <strong>My Daily Tracker</strong> (“the App”). It also explains the choices you have with respect to your information.
    </p>

    <div class="note"><strong>Quick summary:</strong> The App stores your habits, reminders, and settings <em>locally on your device</em>.
    We use Google AdMob to show ads and Google Play Billing for in‑app purchases. We do not sell your data.
    </div>

    <h3>1.1 Information you provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Habit data and notes:</strong> names of habits, completion status, schedules, notes, and related settings. Stored locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Information collected automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Device and identifiers:</strong> certain device information and identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID) may be collected by our partners to deliver and measure ads and for fraud prevention.</li>
      <li><strong>App diagnostics:</strong> basic, non‑personally identifiable analytics/telemetry that Android or our partners may provide to improve stability and performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Payments</h3>
